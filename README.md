A java implementation of the Knight's tour

From the Assignment pdf:
"The Knight's Tour is an ancient and famous chess puzzle. The object is to move a knight from one
square to another on an empty chessboard until it has visited every square exactly once. Write a
program that solves this puzzle using the idea of depth-first search. It's best to make the board size
variable so that you can attempt solutions for smaller boards. The regular 8x8 board can take years to
solve on a desktop computer, but a 5x5 board takes only a minute or so. An animation of the Knight's
Tour problem can be found from the following link:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour#/media/File:Knights-Tour-Animation.gif
It may be easier to think of a new knight being created and remaining on the new square when a move
is made. This way, a knight corresponds to a vertex, and a sequence of knights can be pushed onto a
stack. When the board is completely filled with knights (the stack is full), you win. In this problem the
board is traditionally numbered sequentially, from 1 at the lower-left corner to 64 at the upper-right
corner (or 1 to 25 on a 5Ã—5 board). When looking for its next move, a knight must 1) make a legal
knight's move, 2) not move off the board or onto an already-occupied (visited) square. A legal knight's
move is defined as moving to a square that is two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or two
squares vertically and one square horizontally. The following codes may help you to understand how to
move a knight on a chessboard."

TEST CASES
---------------------------
1) upper right corner (n^2 position) will fail on first position check

2) size=3 will fail ultimately, resulting in 16 moves
one path until failure: 1 8 3 4 9 2 7 6
another path until failure: 1 6 7 2 9 4 3 8
